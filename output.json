Layer 2s are networks built on top of layer-1 blockchains, such as Ethereum, with the aim of making transactions faster and cheaper.The protocol is headed by the pseudonymous @PacmanBlur, one of the co-founders of the popular NFT marketplace Blur. Part of the network's allure can be attributed to its backers \u2013 such as prominent crypto fund Paradigm and \"eGirl Capital,\" a group of crypto-native investors, among others.The caveat is that staked assets can't be withdrawn until the Blast bridge goes live in February. In the meantime, users receive \"Blast points,\" which can be used to redeem an airdrop scheduled for May. Users can receive additional Blast points by introducing other users through unique referral links. As such, Blast is invite-only as of Thursday, requiring a code from an existing user to gain access.Thus far, the majority of the $225 million Blast received has been staked on liquid-staking protocol Lido, making Blast the seventh-largest holder of staked ether, according to Etherscan.But the very nature of restaking on Lido in return for handing out little-known Blast points has attracted criticism from the crypto community.\"Blast is actually insane,\" one crypto trader wrote on X. \"Use points to attract TVL to a chain that doesn't exist, convert the deposited ETH into stETH on a 5-person multisig of anon devs,\" referring to total value locked, or the overall value of assets deposited in the protocol.Some observers have likened Blast points to a pyramid scheme, with early users standing to gain more points on the number of users they bring in. Technical documents show users get an additional 16% points when their invited users bring in more participants, and another 8% if the second level brings in more people.There is also discussion over whether the crowded decentralized finance (DeFi) space needs more layer-2 networks. There are currently 232 blockchains in all, according to DeFiLlama, many of which share functions and users. Of those, Ethereum is the largest, commanding 55% of the total value locked, followed by Tron with 17% and BSC with 6%.Crypto exchanges Coinbase (COIN) and Kraken have recently emerged with their own layer-2 networks in recent months, although it's worth noting that Blast's $225 million total value locked is rapidly approaching that of Coinbase's Base, which has $284 million.The Blast blockchain not being live for another four months has failed the reduce the appetite of investors, who continue to pour capital into the platform despite the ambiguity of Blast points. Mechanism Capital co-founder Andrew Kang said that Blast has been his \"first new L2 investment since Arbitrum.\"Meanwhile, prices of the closely related Blur (BLUR) token has jumped 18% in the past 24 hours, extending its weekly gain to nearly 40% as some investors consider it a beta bet to Blast.Blur founder @PacmanBlur said in a post earlier this week that Blast was an extension of the Blur ecosystem, letting Blur users earn yields on idle assets while improving the technical aspects required to offer sophisticated NFT products to users.Edited by Sheldon Reback.", "time": "Nov 23, 2023 at 11:25 a.m. UTC", "author": "Oliver Knight", "tags": ["latestnews", "trendingnews"], "views": 0}, "0.5042608607316721": {"imageUrls": ["https://www.coindesk.com/resizer/wxMEjT5J36vBQrOS4gILIu0xbsA=/570x321/filters:quality(80):format(jpg)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coindesk/YJIDIEYCXVBLDCXDVWV7CIVCGY.jpg"], "headline": "Coinbase to Suspend Binance USD Stablecoin, Saying It Doesn\u2019t Meet Listing Standards", "category_id": "650d45276bb89616f4e084a1", "category": "Alt News", "summary": "The suspension affects Coinbase.com, Coinbase Pro, Coinbase Exchange and Coinbase Prime.

But it sure is mooning, apparently linked to the recent success of Binance Smart Chain. ", "content": "Why wait for the Coinbase listing of its shares on the Nasdaq? There\u2019s already a way \u2013 in cryptocurrency markets \u2013 to bet on the world\u2019s biggest cryptocurrency exchange.It\u2019s a digital token linked to the success of Binance, which boasts a higher spot trading volume than Coinbase, according to the data site CoinGecko. The token, binance coin (BNB), has surged 14-fold in price this year, for a market value of $86 billion.\u00a0Some cryptocurrency investors see BNB as a way to get excess return over a simple purchase of bitcoin, whose doubling in price this year looks almost paltry by comparison, Joshua Frank, co-founder and CEO of crypto data firm The TIE, told CoinDesk in an interview.\u201cFunds can\u2019t just buy bitcoin, because if the funds just buy bitcoin it\u2019s not worth it for their investors,\u201d Frank said. Binance coin \u201cis one of those larger coins that they can get exposure to, and they can put a large position in.\u201dBNB's cumulative year-to-date percentage returns versus bitcoin and ether.  Binance press officials said they didn\u2019t know why BNB has rallied so dramatically this year. The token's price \u201cis not something that can be controlled,\u201d according to a spokesperson.\u00a0But cryptocurrency analysts said Binance\u2019s recent business moves, including launching a blockchain network to compete with Ethereum for a share of the decentralized finance market, known as DeFi, have helped to boost the BNB token\u2019s prospects.Unlike Coinbase\u2019s soon-to-be-issued shares, BNB tokens confer no equity ownership rights. Binance is a closely-held firm, still led by its founder, Changpeng Zhao, often referred to by his initials, CZ.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Instead, BNB is considered an \u201cexchange token.\u201d It can be used to pay fees on various Binance trading platforms, sometimes entitling the payers to discounts, or even as a currency on blockchain networks sponsored by the exchange. Investors in the token are essentially betting on its supply and demand, which effectively translates to a bet on the success of the Binance ecosystem.\u00a0The rise of Binance Smart ChainBinance Smart Chain (BSC), a less decentralized public blockchain that\u2019s considered a competitor with the Ethereum blockchain, has been quite successful. With transaction fees that are about 35 times cheaper, BSC has overtaken Ethereum in the first three months of 2021 for daily unique active wallets, according to DappRadar\u2019s 2021 Q1 overview report on April 1.In March, the total value locked in Venus, the top decentralized money-market protocol on BSC, surpassed that of some of the most popular DeFi projects on Ethereum, including Uniswap and Compound, DappRadar wrote in its report, citing data from Defistation.The huge success of Binance Smart Chain has played a significant role in BNB\u2019s rapid growing value. As a \u201cdiscount token,\u201d BNB offers discounts for trading on both Binance\u2019s decentralized exchange (Binance DEX) and Binance, according to Nick Mancini, research analyst at Trade The Chain.The TIE\u2019s Frank told CoinDesk that many crypto-native hedge funds have recognized BSC as a \u201cmuch cheaper and more effective way\u201d to access DeFi than stomaching Ethereum\u2019s transaction fees, known as \u201cgas,\u201d where rates have soared due to network congestion.BNB is used as gas to pay for DeFi deployment to BSC.Mancini speculated that BNB\u2019s market capitalization might eventually overtake that of ether, the Ethereum blockchain network\u2019s native cryptocurrency. Ether prices have tripled this year, to a market value just over $260 billion.\u00a0\u201cIf BNB and ether continue to grow at the same rate, BNB will flip ether within the next two to four months,\u201d Mancini said.Alt seasonIt can\u2019t be overstated that BNB\u2019s price surge has come during \u201calt season\u201d \u2013 a stretch of time where crypto traders have bid up so-called altcoins, ostensibly due to a lull in bitcoin\u2019s rally.This is evidenced by recent drop in bitcoin\u2019s share of all cryptocurrencies\u2019 value, known as the market dominance ratio, to a two-year low.Crypto hedge funds trying to beat the market may also have been forced to invest in altcoins like BNB.Fund managers typically impose a \u201c2 and 20\u201d annual fee structure, meaning a 2% management fee of a fund\u2019s net asset value and a 20% performance fee. Since there are so many ways for investors to hold bitcoin at low cost, crypto hedge funds have to come up with \u201cunique ways\u201d of beating the largest cryptocurrency\u2019s returns for less costly fees, Frank said.\u201cFunds can\u2019t just buy bitcoin because if the funds just buy bitcoin, it\u2019s not worth it for their investors,\u201d Frank said. \u201cFunds have to go out and deploy so much capital, and binance coin is one of those larger coins that they can get exposure to and they can put a large position in.\u201dCoinbase direct listing\u2019s spilloverThe Coinbase stock listing might be another potential driver of BNB\u2019s gains.While Binance\u2019s CZ has told CoinDesk that the company does not plan to go public, the token ecosystem might be benefiting from speculation over Coinbase\u2019s value.A pre-listing tracking contract traded on the FTX exchange puts Coinbase\u2019s share price at about $634, which would imply a market value for the U.S. exchange north of $160 billion.\u00a0\u00a0As CoinDesk reported previously, exchange tokens have skyrocketed since last year, sometimes traded as a crypto-native proxy for\u00a0 equity in the companies behind the exchanges, arguably the industry\u2019s top revenue-getters. Another exchange token, FTX\u2019s own FTT,\u00a0 has posted year-to-date gains of more than 800%, per Messari data.\u201cBy buying these exchange tokens, it may be a \u2018buy the rumor, sell the news\u2019 type of event, where things are going to run up so much in the next few days in anticipation\u201d of the Coinbase listing, Frank said.As rewards go up, risks also increaseOf course, with the extreme gains in BNB come major risks.Paramount among those, in a cryptocurrency industry where decentralization is prized, is that Binance is so centralized: BNB is owned and created by Binance, and the Binance team still owns over 80% of BNB, according to Mancini.It means that \u201cthere is a centralized authority to answer if regulators came knocking,\u201d Mancini said. Contrast that with ether, which is fully open-source. \u201cThis regulatory risk can create a serious hurdle for BNB being listed on other exchanges, or being allowed to grow its utility on American or European soil.\u201dRyan Watkins, a research analyst at Messari, also criticized BSC\u2019s centralization in a recent tweet thread, arguing that BSC is just a \u201ccopycat\u201d of Ethereum.\u201cThe reason why BSC is faster and more scalable is not because of some magical technological innovation,\u201d Watkins wrote. \u201cIt\u2019s instead the magic of centralization. BSC is an Ethereum fork with a centralized validator set. That\u2019s it, nothing more.\u201dHowever, hedge funds or even average crypto investors might not care about that too much, at least in the short term, The TIE\u2019s Frank said.\u201cThe average consumer just wants a good user experience,\u201d Frank said. Meanwhile, \u201cif you are a hedge fund that\u2019s trading and taking small-term positions or small-term bets, you also care a lot less about decentralization risks.\u201dBNB\u2019s low-price strategy also might eventually lose its competitive allure.\u00a0\u201cEventually everyone reaches 0% fees on trades,\u201d Mancini said. \u201cAlthough BNB offers cheaper trading right now, eventually that benefit will go away.\u201d", "time": "Apr 13, 2021 at 8:31 p.m. UTC", "author": "Muyao Shen", "tags": ["trendingnews", "featurednews"], "views": 0}, "0.21030395407436608": {"imageUrls": ["https://www.coindesk.com/resizer/gMo4cB5oYBTRrZ2anipCetNHe_o=/570x379/filters:quality(80):format(jpg)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coindesk/DHKWRQ3O6JDATMGTDT2DI5FETM.png"], "headline": "Market Wrap: Bitcoin Near $53K After Major Drop as Ether Tops $2,800 for First Time", "category_id": "650d45276bb89616f4e084a1", "category": "Alt News", "summary": "Bitcoin\u2019s dominance is less than half of the crypto market as assets like ether and binance coin captivate traders.

For now, there\u2019s a cap of 100,000 Swiss francs ($111,300). \u201cAs the home of the Crypto Valley, it is important to us to further promote and simplify the use of cryptocurrencies in everyday life,\u201d said Zug\u2019s finance director, Heinz Tannler, when the tax initiative was announced.BIDDERS UP: Christie\u2019s, the 255-year-old auction house of art, antiques and apparently meterorites, will now accept cryptocurrency for payment, Bloomberg reported. \u201cThat Christie\u2019s is willing to accept cryptocurrency for the first time,\u201d according to the piece, \u201csays more about the auction house\u2019s attempt to break into new audiences than it does about a shift in the traditional art market.\u201dBitcoin WatchBitcoin beating gold where it counts right now - on the inflation tradeBitcoin continues to outshine gold amid calls for more fiscal spending to boost the U.S. economy back to full strength.The world\u2019s biggest cryptocurrency set a new record price of $52,954.49 on Friday, CoinDesk's Omkar Godbole reported, having scaled the $50,000 mark two days prior. Meanwhile, gold fell to $1,760 early Friday to hit the lowest level since July.Bitcoin's potential use as a hedge against inflation, and possibly a better one than gold, has become a key narrative on Wall Street as well as in Washington.\u00a0In an interview with CNBC on Thursday, U.S. Treasury Secretary\u00a0Janet Yellen said that the proposed $1.9 trillion stimulus package could help the U.S. get back to full employment in a year, a sign that President Joe Biden's administration is undaunted in pushing for a large bill. She added that the risk associated with delivering too little stimulus is greater than the price of doing something big.But she added that bitcoin is a \"highly speculative asset.\"\u00a0Jeffrey Gundlach, CEO of the $130 billion DoubleLine Capital and one of the world's most renowned bond investors, tweeted Thursday that he was a \"long-term dollar bear\" and that bitcoin was \"maybe the Stimulus Asset\" and that it \"doesn't look like gold is.\" Gundlach previously had said he didn't believe in bitcoin.\"Lots of liquid poured into a funnel creates a torrent,\" Gundlach wrote in the tweet.\u00a0Analysts for JPMorgan wrote in an 86-page report\u00a0that bitcoin's \"competition with gold as an 'alternative' currency is here to stay,\" though they called it an \"economic sideshow\" in that \"the rise of digital finance is the real post-Covid-19 story.\"\u00a0Bill Gates, the Microsoft-founder-turned-philanthropist, said he's neutral, notable perhaps because he didn't immediately pan it, as some other successful U.S. business people have done, later to miss out on big market gains. (Looking at you, Warren Buffett.) \u00a0\"The past couple of weeks have seen fundamental arguments made for choosing silver, bitcoin, and Treasuries over gold,\" wrote\u00a0Edward Moya, senior market analyst for the foreign-exchange broker OANDA. \"Bitcoin has benefited from relentless retail demand and on expectations that institutional interest is still growing.\"Market MovesBinance coin shoots to $40B valuation, trailing only bitcoin and etherBinance coin's price surge this month has pushed its market valuation to almost $40 billion, ranking it third among all digital assets behind bitcoin and Ethereum's ether. While cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase's valuation soars to a $77 billion valuation based on private-share trading, rival Binance is seeing rocketing demand for its exchange tokens in digital-asset markets.Prices for the BNB tokens have jumped five-fold\u00a0this month, for a market value of about $40 billion. According to Messari, that valuation makes Binance coin the third-biggest digital asset after bitcoin and Ethereum's ether.The token serves as Binance's internal currency: It can be used to buy cryptocurrencies on the exchange and pay fees. So the jump in BNB's price might reflect speculation that Binance, already one of the world's biggest cryptocurrency exchanges by trading volume, will occupy a dominant role in the future of fast-growing digital-asset markets.\u00a0\u00a0According to CoinDesk's Sebastian Sinclair, the price rise might be tied to increased interest in a decentralized financial application called PancakeSwap, which helps users find yield-earning opportunities in crypto markets. PancakeSwap runs on Binance's own blockchain, Binance Smart Chain.\u00a0Daily volumes on PancakeSwap have shot up to more than $1 billion, from $37 million at the start of the year, CoinDesk's Will Foxley reported.The BNB token is needed to process transactions on the Binance Smart Chain, similar to the way ether is used on the Ethereum blockchain.For what it's worth, the BNB token itself is set atop the Ethereum blockchain, under the common ERC-20 standard for digital tokens.\u00a0That helps explain why a tokenized or \"synthetic\" version of the BNB token, called wrapped BNB (WBNB), appears to be the primary token traded on PancakeSwap within the Binance Smart Chain ecosystem, according to CoinGecko, a crypto-markets tracking site:CoinGecko's breakdown of transaction volumes on PancakeSwap shows the dominant role of wrapped BNB tokens (WBNB).\u00a0\u00a0Opinions and ObservationsDEFI AT $400 BILLION?

Sin embargo, los analistas no est\u00e1n de acuerdo sobre si la aprobaci\u00f3n atenuar\u00e1 la notoria volatilidad de los precios del bitcoin, que ha afectado su atractivo como activo refugio.Si bien la cadena de bloques de Bitcoin est\u00e1 descentralizada, su token, BTC, se concentra en manos de un n\u00famero relativamente peque\u00f1o de propietarios, conocidos como ballenas. Debido al tama\u00f1o de sus explotaciones, estas ballenas ejercen una gran influencia sobre los precios, provocando a menudo oscilaciones violentas.

La liquidez se refiere a la capacidad de un mercado para absorber grandes pedidos a precios estables.\"La volatilidad tiende a caer a medida que el espacio madura, se desarrolla m\u00e1s liquidez institucional e infraestructura y el activo se aclimata a la normalidad\", dijo a trav\u00e9s de Telegram Richard Rosenblum, cofundador y presidente del proveedor de liquidez criptogr\u00e1fica GSR.En los mercados de valores, un aumento en la propiedad de ETF tiende a aumentar la liquidez de las acciones subyacentes, seg\u00fan un art\u00edculo de 2018 de Mehmet Saglam, profesor asociado de finanzas en la Facultad de Negocios Carl H. Lindner de la Universidad de Cincinnati; Tugkan Tuzun, economista de la Junta de la Reserva Federal y Russ Wermers, profesor asociado de finanzas en la Smith School of Business.\"Utilizando varias medidas de liquidez, encontramos que los ETF aumentan la liquidez de sus acciones subyacentes. Encontramos que las medidas de iliquidez, los diferenciales efectivos, los diferenciales cotizados, Amihud y el d\u00e9ficit de implementaci\u00f3n aumentan cuando la propiedad de la acci\u00f3n del ETF disminuye\", seg\u00fan seg\u00fan el documento, que examin\u00f3 las acciones del S&P 500 y Nasdaq.\"Al examinar la din\u00e1mica de los precios en las ejecuciones de grandes \u00f3rdenes, encontramos que un canal principal de mayor liquidez se debe a que los arbitrajistas negocian contra posibles errores de fijaci\u00f3n de precios entre el ETF y la cesta de acciones subyacentes\", dec\u00eda el documento.Los \u00e1rbitros toman posiciones compensatorias en dos mercados para beneficiarse de las diferencias de precios entre ellos. Por ejemplo, si un ETF cotiza con un descuento sobre el valor de las acciones subyacentes, un arbitrajista comprar\u00e1 el ETF y vender\u00e1 las acciones subyacentes, agregando efectivamente liquidez a los activos subyacentes.Volatilidad por creaci\u00f3n de efectivoLaurent Kssis, experto en ETF y asesor de comercio de criptomonedas de CEC Capital, adopta la posici\u00f3n opuesta, argumentando que los ETF al contado podr\u00edan convertirse en una fuente de volatilidad en los precios de BTC .Los ETF se crean y canjean en especie o en efectivo. La creaci\u00f3n en especie, ampliamente utilizada, implica que los participantes autorizados (AP) depositen una canasta de valores en el emisor a cambio de nuevas unidades de ETF. En la creaci\u00f3n de efectivo, los AP proporcionan efectivo y el emisor compra el activo real.Seg\u00fan Kssis, en la creaci\u00f3n de efectivo, el emisor est\u00e1 expuesto a la diferencia entre los precios a los que se han adquirido los activos y el precio de referencia diario al que se calcula el valor liquidativo (NAV).\"Necesitamos un precio de referencia donde auditemos el fondo para calcular el NAV\", dijo Ksiss en una entrevista en Telegram. \"Con las creaciones en especie, los AP compran activos y los entregan al emisor. Con las creaciones en efectivo, si el emisor logra comprarlos m\u00e1s barato, obtiene una peque\u00f1a ganancia, pero si los compra m\u00e1s caro, desembolsa el exceso. \"\"Por lo tanto, en el momento de la correcci\u00f3n, habr\u00e1 m\u00e1s arbitrajistas operando en ese canal de tiempo y creando volumen para impulsar el mercado o negociar discrepancias entre el precio en efectivo y de futuros de Bitcoin, creando efectivamente volatilidad inadvertidamente durante ese per\u00edodo\", agreg\u00f3 Kssis. .Recientemente, hubo rumores en X de que la SEC quiere que los solicitantes de ETF trabajen mediante la creaci\u00f3n de efectivo.Edited by Sheldon Reback.", "time": "Dec 1, 2023 at 2:15 p.m. UTC", "author": "Omkar Godbole", "tags": ["trendingnews", "latestnews"], "views": 0}, "0.6935593058395247": {"imageUrls": ["https://www.coindesk.com/resizer/LnhRqjbcyWl4XOuiK1ArLd3wRrY=/570x298/filters:quality(80):format(jpg)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coindesk/RSPSSL7PYRADNDFATIQRYKIA7A.png"], "headline": "Avalanche y Helium lideran las ganancias criptogr\u00e1ficas mensuales a medida que la consolidaci\u00f3n alcista de Bitcoin estimula la convocatoria de la temporada de altcoins", "category_id": "650d45276bb89616f4e084a0", "category": "Bitcoin News", "summary": "Los tokens en los \u00edndices del sector DeFi y Cultura y entretenimiento ganaron entre un 39% y un 42% durante el \u00faltimo mes, lo que muestra la amplitud cada vez mayor del Rally...", "content": "Los tokens m\u00e1s peque\u00f1os superaron al Bitcoin durante el mes de noviembre alcista para los criptomercados.AVAX, HNT, BLUR y RUNE estuvieron entre los de mejor desempe\u00f1o y duplicaron sus precios en un mes.La amplitud cada vez mayor del Rally de las criptomonedas indica una \"temporada alternativa\", dijo ByteTree.Noviembre trajo ganancias explosivas para las altcoins, ya que una amplia gama de criptomonedas m\u00e1s peque\u00f1as superaron al Bitcoin [BTC], lo que provoc\u00f3 llamados a una temporada de altcoins.El token nativo de Avalanche [AVAX] aument\u00f3 un 97% durante el \u00faltimo mes, el mayor aumento entre los activos digitales de gran capitalizaci\u00f3n, benefici\u00e1ndose de la noticia de que los gigantes financieros JPMorgan y Apollo est\u00e1n utilizando la red para probar la tokenizaci\u00f3n de activos del mundo real.Los vol\u00famenes de transacciones en la cadena de bloques de Avalanche tambi\u00e9n experimentaron un aumento durante el mes, registrando su mayor tr\u00e1fico semanal de 2 mil millones de d\u00f3lares en transacciones en un a\u00f1o, se\u00f1al\u00f3 un informe de la firma de an\u00e1lisis de cadenas de bloques IntoTheBlock.El informe tambi\u00e9n se\u00f1al\u00f3 un aumento considerable en las entradas a Avalanche durante los dos \u00faltimos trimestres del a\u00f1o, con 79 millones de d\u00f3lares en entradas netas en el tercer trimestre y 56 millones de d\u00f3lares en el cuarto trimestre hasta finales de noviembre, lo que ayud\u00f3 a rejuvenecer el ecosistema.Avalanche weekly transaction volumes (IntoTheBlock)El protocolo de comunicaciones de Internet de las cosas Helium [HNT] tambi\u00e9n se destac\u00f3 con un Rally del 110% el mes pasado, seg\u00fan muestran los datos de CoinDesk .

My name is Noelle Acheson, CoinDesk collaborator and author of the Crypto is Macro Now newsletter on Substack. On today\u2019s show we\u2019re talking about the crypto market rally, energy prices, how they impact bitcoin, and more. So you don\u2019t miss an episode, be sure to follow the podcast on your platform of choice, and turn on notifications. And just a reminder, CoinDesk is a news source and does not provide investment advice.Now, a markets roundup.December is starting off positive in crypto markets. Earlier today, bitcoin reached its year-to-date high of $38,800 dollars. Ether briefly passed above 2,110 dollars. According to CoinDesk Indices, at 9am Eastern time this morning, bitcoin was trading up 1 and three quarters of a percent at 38,357 dollars. Ether was up two and a quarter percent, trading at 2,080 dollars.Elsewhere, Avalanche is up 6.5%, Lido DAO token is up almost 6%, Polkadot is up almost 5%. According to bitcoinmonthlyreturn.com, the largest crypto asset by market cap climbed 8.8% in November, higher than the average November gain since 2014 of 6.4%. In case you\u2019re curious, the average December gain over the same time period is almost 9%.In macro matters, Federal Reserve officials are trying to dampen the market\u2019s expectations of rate cuts by May 2024. Several central bankers has been out in public over the past few days, stressing that a pause is warranted, but that rate cuts were not being talked about.It doesn\u2019t seem to be working. Futures are now pricing in a 30% probability of two rate cuts by May, up from 8% just a month ago. They\u2019re also pricing in a 25% probability of three rate cuts by June. My take is that the economy would have to be in really bad shape with skyrocketing unemployment for the Fed to react that drastically. The stock market does not seem to be pricing that in.I\u2019ve talked about the Atlanta Fed GDPNow model before on this show \u2013 the last time was on the November 9th show if you want to go and give that a listen for some background. Well, that model \u2013 which has been more accurate than economist forecasts so far this year \u2013 is pointing to GDP growth in Q4 of 1.8%. And earlier this week, the US third quarter GDP growth was revised up. You may remember that it came in at 4.9% year-on-year growth, up from 2.1% in the second quarter. Well, it turns out that was wrong, the correct figure is 5.2%.So, growth is slowing, from 5.2% down to maybe 1.8%, which is no surprise. But to go from here to a sharp enough recession to warrant two rate hikes within the next five months \u2013 to me, that feels like a stretch.Later today, we hear from Fed Chair Jerome Powell - a lot depends on what sort of tone he adopts, and we could see some strong market moves.  Meanwhile, there are some signs that traders are adjusting \u2013 earlier today, the US 10-year yield was off its recent lows, back to 4.3%.In stocks, US indices were mixed yesterday. The S&P 500 was up four tenths, Nasdaq slid two tenths, and the Dow Jones jumped 1 and a half percent. All closed November with solid gains, led by the Nasdaq which climbed almost 11%. The S&P 500 rose 9% in November, as did the Dow Jones, delivering its best month in more than a year. Futures today are pointing to a weak opening.European indices closed November on a positive note, with the FTSE 100 up four tenths, the German DAX up three tenths and the Eurostoxx 600 up a half a percent. For the month of November, the German DAX was up almost 10%, its steepest monthly gain since October of last year.Asian markets closed November on a weak note. Bloomberg reported earlier that Chinese President Xi Jinping may postpone a party congress held every five years to plan the country\u2019s economic agenda. Traders are not taking this to be a good sign. In trading today, Japan\u2019s Nikkei index dropped almost two tenths, the Shanghai Composite was flat and the Hang Seng slumped 1 and a quarter percent, to finish at its lowest point so far this year.In commodities, oil prices dropped yesterday despite an announcement from OPEC+ of further reductions to production quotas. The cuts would further reduce production by 900,000 barrels a day as of January. This adds to the 1.3 million barrels-a-day cut already in place from Saudi Arabia and Russia, which will be extended into the first quarter.Prices dropping on this news may sound surprising, since in theory, production cuts should boost the oil price. But, it turns out that these production cuts are voluntary, which is confusing the market as it\u2019s not clear whether they will end up being adopted. Angola, for example, has already said that it has no intention of complying. This hints at dissent and discord within OPEC+, which is rattling the market.Another cause for market concern is the message that OPEC+ thinks that demand will be weak enough to warrant this measure. In other words, OPEC+ thinks the price is heading down.  Yesterday, the Brent crude benchmark fell 2%. Today it is recovering some ground, up half a percent to trade at 81 dollars a barrel.Gold is still holding at 2,040 dollars an ounce, and is headed for its third straight weekly advance.Stay with us \u2013 after the break I\u2019m going to address listener questions about energy prices and bitcoin.Welcome back! By now, you probably know that on Friday\u2019s, I pick a reader question to attempt to answer. Many thanks to all of you who have reached out, I do love finding out what you\u2019re interested in.  A couple of the questions this week had to do with the oil price, which - as I explained before the break - is heading down.So, the paraphrased question I\u2019m going to tackle is: Would lower oil prices be good or bad for bitcoin?This is a timely question indeed, especially if you think oil prices will continue to drop. 81 dollars a barrel isn\u2019t particularly low, especially compared to the 72 dollars a barrel we saw at the start of the summer. But if indeed we get lower global demand next year due to a slowdown, and especially if OPEC+ doesn\u2019t get much internal coordination to support the price, it\u2019s not a stretch to expect prices to trend down over the next year.Looking at charts to detect historical patterns isn\u2019t very helpful, because recent history has been distorted by geopolitical events. And going back further in time, the bitcoin market was small and relatively isolated from macro forces.So, that means we have to think through what the effects of lower oil prices on bitcoin could be going forward. Most of them are positive, and there are two angles to look at.First, there\u2019s the mining angle. Since energy is one of the main recurring costs of mining bitcoin, lower electricity prices make bitcoin mining more profitable \u2013 this means a couple of things, both of which are good for the network.If miners are more profitable, they have less incentive to sell their newly mined bitcoin in the market. This should lessen a significant source of selling pressure. Also, if mining is more economical, more miners will come online, further distributing the security of the network.Second, there\u2019s the macro angle. Another way lower oil prices are good for bitcoin is through lower inflation. This may sound counterintuitive, because bitcoin is supposed to be an inflation hedge, and so surely with lower inflation, demand for bitcoin would drop?The thing is, while in theory bitcoin should be an inflation hedge, because it has a verifiable and programmatic hard cap, it hasn\u2019t typically acted like one. Inflation shot up last year and bitcoin, well, bitcoin didn\u2019t. In previous cycles, bitcoin soared even though inflation wasn\u2019t a problem.So, bitcoin in theory can be an inflation hedge, but it is also many other things.One of its buckets is that of risk assets, or assets that have long duration and relatively high volatility. These tend to be driven by monetary liquidity \u2013 when there\u2019s plenty of money sloshing around the system, it has to go somewhere. Since lower inflation is in theory accompanied by lower interest rates, risk assets become relatively more attractive, especially bitcoin which doesn\u2019t have to worry about corporate risk or possible hits to earnings expectations.In sum, lower energy prices leads to lower inflation which should lead to lower interest rates and higher monetary liquidity. Good for bitcoin.To take the other side, it can be argued that lower oil prices are a sign of low demand which usually stems from low global economic growth. And unexpectedly low growth could cause a sharp stock market correction, which could drag crypto markets down as well.  Any such correction should be short-lived, however, as sentiment settles and the more positive forces take over.But, having said all that, bitcoin and energy prices themselves are influenced by so many factors that establishing a clear relationship between them is tough. In markets, things are rarely simple. The theory may make sense, but markets get hit by so many variables that short-term moves sometimes make no sense at all. That\u2019s one of the reasons I find them so fascinating, and why it\u2019s so much fun exploring them with you every day.Thanks for listening - That\u2019s it for today\u2019s show!", "time": "Dec 1, 2023 at 4:42 p.m. UTC", "author": "Noelle Acheson", "tags": ["trendingnews", "latestnews"], "views": 0}, "0.19688795004764348": {"imageUrls": ["https://www.coindesk.com/resizer/hRlumxrJIEoWt8grsomDjnBtNHM=/570x380/filters:quality(80):format(jpg)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coindesk/HQX3K7EX4RHHXELJZU6DBEQP3Y.jpg"], "headline": "Australia Has Third-Highest Rate of Crypto Adoption in the World: Finder Survey", "category_id": "650d45276bb89616f4e084a1", "category": "Alt News", "summary": "Almost 18% of the country\u2019s population owns crypto.", "content": "Australia is more bullish on cryptocurrencies than most other countries around the world, according to a survey published by comparison site Finder on Sunday.The survey, based on the site\u2019s Cryptocurrency Adoption Index, measures the growth of crypto globally through a regular survey of more than 41,600 individuals across 22 countries.Finder\u2019s survey found Australia has the third-highest rate of crypto ownership at 17.8%, topping such countries  as Indonesia (16.7%) and the city of Hong Kong, a special administrative region of China (15.8%).The global average is 11.4%, according to Finder\u2019s results.\u201cAustralian\u2019s love to gamble,\u201d Finder CEO Fred Schebesta told CoinDesk via Signal on Monday. \u201cThey are also super savvy in terms of finance ... the laws around crypto make it super smooth to buy and sell.\u201dOf the nearly 1 in 5 adults in Australia who own some form of crypto, Finder found bitcoin is the most popular coin as 65.2% of Australians who own crypto own the world\u2019s largest crypto, the fifth-highest percentage of all 22 countries surveyed.Ethereum, meanwhile, is the second-most popular coin in the country with a share of 42.1% among those who own crypto, while cardano\u2019s share comes in third at 26.4%.Two other cryptos Australian crypto owners hold are dogecoin (23%) and binance coin (14.6%), according to Finder\u2019s results.\u201cBanking in Australia is really smooth and super easy to withdraw and deposit,\u201d Schebesta added. \u201cOther countries have a lot more laws and challenges around getting your money in and out [of crypto].\u201dRead more: Top Australian Crypto Exchanges Say They Aren\u2019t Threatened by the Bigger Players", "time": "Oct 19, 2021 at 12:45 a.m. UTC", "author": "Sebastian Sinclair", "tags": ["latestnews", "breakingnews"], "views": 0}, "0.6507386471975377": {"imageUrls": ["https://www.coindesk.com/resizer/ssqY76xjn4dVWTT8g2-GS7Ry57c=/570x321/filters:quality(80):format(jpg)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coindesk/4IZYFAEL7JGJZNLF7PGYDITJVE.jpg"], "headline": "Gauging Spot Bitcoin ETF's Impact on Price Volatility", "category_id": "650d45276bb89616f4e084a0", "category": "Bitcoin News", "summary": "Some analysts expect bitcoin to mature into a less volatile asset following the introduction of spot ETFs in the U.S, while others say potential \"cash creation\" structures wil...", "content": "Spot ETFs could reduce the influence of crypto whales in the market, helping bitcoin become less volatile, analysts said.In traditional markets, spot ETFs tend to boost liquidity in the underlying asset.One observer said volatility may remain high if the expected ETFs involve \"cash creation.\"The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is widely expected to greenlight one or more exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that invest directly in bitcoin (BTC) rather than in futures tied to the cryptocurrency.Analyst consensus is that approval will have a bullish impact on prices. Analysts disagree, however, on whether approval will subdue bitcoin's notorious price volatility, which has dented its appeal as a haven asset.While the Bitcoin blockchain is decentralized, its token, BTC, is concentrated in the hands of a relatively small number of owners, known as whales. Because of the size of their holdings, these whales hold great influence over prices, often triggering violent swings. A spot ETF, which is supposed to track the value of the underlying assets closely, could trim their influence by broadening the owner base.\"A spot ETF would provide bitcoin exposure to a much wider swath of market participants, including institutional investors and financial advisors,\" Nate Geraci, the president of registered investment adviser The ETF Store, said in an interview conducted over direct messaging on X. \"A deeper pool of bitcoin investors via the ETF wrapper could theoretically help lower volatility since there would be a greater number and diversity of investors. That should make it more difficult for larger bitcoin whales to push prices around.\"According to estimates from Galaxy Digital, the addressable market size of a U.S. bitcoin ETF could be $14 trillion in just one year after the spot ETF launch, and $39 trillion in the third year.More liquiditySuch a strong uptake could boost liquidity in the underlying asset, ensuring less volatile trading conditions where prices don't fluctuate rapidly. Liquidity refers to the ability of a market to absorb large orders at stable prices.\"Volatility tends to drop as the space matures, more institutional liquidity and infrastructure develops, and the asset acclimates to normalcy,\" Richard Rosenblum, co-founder and president at crypto liquidity provider GSR, said over Telegram.In the equity markets, an increase in ETF ownership tends to boost liquidity in the underlying stocks, according to a 2018 paper by Mehmet Saglam, associate professor of finance at the Carl H. Lindner College of Business at the University of Cincinnati; Tugkan Tuzun, an economist at the Federal Reserve Board and Russ Wermers, associate professor of finance at the Smith School of Business.\"Using several measures of liquidity, we find that ETFs increase the liquidity of their underlying stocks. We find that illiquidity measures, e\ufb00ective spreads, quoted spreads, Amihud, and implementation shortfall all increase when the ETF ownership of the stock goes down,\" according to the paper, which examined S&P 500 and Nasdaq stocks.\"Examining the price dynamics over large order executions, we find that one primary channel of higher liquidity is due to arbitrageurs trading against potential mispricings between the ETF and the basket of underlying stocks,\" the paper said.Arbitrageurs take offsetting positions in two markets to profit from pricing differences between them. For instance, if an ETF trades at a discount to the value of the underlying stocks, an arbitrageur will buy the ETF and sell underlying stocks, effectively adding liquidity to the underlying assets.Volatility due to cash creationLaurent Kssis, an ETF expert and crypto trading adviser at CEC Capital, takes the opposing position, arguing that spot ETFs could become a source of BTC price volatility.ETFs are created and redeemed in kind or in cash. The widely used in-kind creation involves authorized participants (APs) depositing a basket of securities with the issuer in exchange for new ETF units. Under cash creation, APs provide cash and the issuer purchases the actual asset.According to Kssis, in cash creation, the issuer is exposed to the difference between the prices at which assets have been acquired and the daily reference price at which the net asset value (NAV) is calculated.\"We need a reference price where we audit the fund to calculate the NAV,\" Kssis said in a Telegram interview. \"With in-kind creations, APs purchase assets and deliver them to the issuer. With cash creations, if the issuer manages to buy them cheaper, then it makes a little profit, but if it buys them higher, it coughs up the excess.\"\"Hence, at the time of fixing, you will have more arbitrageurs trading around that time channel and creating volume to either push the market or trade discrepancies between the cash and futures price of bitcoin, effectively creating volatility inadvertently during that period,\" Kssis added.Recently, there were rumors on the X that the SEC wants the ETF applicants to work through cash creation.Edited by Sheldon Reback.", "time": "Dec 1, 2023 at 2:15 p.m. UTC", "author": "Omkar Godbole", "tags": ["latestnews", "featurednews"], "views": 0}, "0.4850255376087449": {"imageUrls": ["https://www.coindesk.com/resizer/qmGI8enVC2lp1XjGsUMMKA_CKlQ=/570x320/filters:quality(80):format(jpg)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coindesk/7CZIZCZFXBCFHJDQVOY3VKVYSQ.jpg"], "headline": "Bitcoin Dominance at 2-Year Low as XRP, Binance's BNB Rally", "category_id": "650d45276bb89616f4e084a1", "category": "Alt News", "summary": "Bitcoin prices have doubled this year, but several major altcoins have risen by many multiples.

That's down from about 70% at the start of the year. The decline iwas driven in recent weeks by powerful rallies in the likes of binance coin (BNB) and XRP (XRP), since bitcoin's market value has held steady at around $1 trillion or slightly above.

But over the following several months, rival teams Polygon and then Matter Labs, which stands behind the zkSync project, offered competing proposals aiming to woo Celo's business.Celo ranks as the 27th-biggest blockchain in decentralized finance, with a total value locked, or TVL, of $102 million, according to the website DeFiLlama. That's a tiny fraction of the $26.2 billion in the Ethereum ecosystem, and still well behind Solana's $656 million.But because the teams are at pains to establish dominant layer-2 ecosystems \u2013 with first-mover benefits at stake such as the wherewithal to set industry standards and aggregate liquidity \u2013 Celo's choice has evolved into a surprisingly competitive proxy battle.\"Note that we are selecting codebases and sub-components here, so we feel it is less useful to directly compare metrics like TVL, transaction count, users, except as indicators of what a closer collaboration and/or shared bridge between the two ecosystems could look like in future,\" cLabs wrote. \"This exercise is not to select a 'best L2 stack.' It's to figure out which is the best fit for the specific technical and non-technical needs of the Celo L2 project.\"Priorities laid out in the new CLabs proposed framework include \"simple migration, with minimal downtime,\" preserving low gas fees and Ethereum compatibility.The document makes no mention of the ongoing debate between optimistic rollups versus ZK rollups, a key design choice that experts say brings important tradeoffs between operating cost and speed.What's clear is the desire of the cLabs team to get on with it \u2013 perhaps a nod to how fast the blockchain landscape is evolving.\"Our objective is to deliver CEL2 as soon as possible, minimizing implementation risk,\" according to the proposal. \"We favor projects that have been audited and deployed and proven in production, vs. projects whose designs are subject to ongoing change or whose implementations are not yet proven.\"Edited by Nick Baker.", "time": "Nov 29, 2023 at 11:54 p.m. UTC", "author": "Bradley Keoun", "tags": ["latestnews", "breakingnews"], "views": 0}}
